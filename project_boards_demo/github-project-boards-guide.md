## 📌 What is a GitHub Project Board?  
A GitHub Project Board is a visual tool that helps you organize issues, pull requests, and notes into customizable columns such as **To Do, In Progress, and Done**.

## 🎯 How to Create a GitHub Project Board  

### 1️⃣ **Navigate to Your Repository**
- Go to your repository on GitHub.  
- Click on the **Projects** tab.  

### 2️⃣ **Create a New Project**
- Click **New Project**.  
- Choose **Table** or **Board** view.  
- Name your project (e.g., "Sprint 5 Development").  

### 3️⃣ **Add Columns**
- By default, GitHub provides three columns:  
  - 🟡 **To Do** – Tasks not started yet.  
  - 🔵 **In Progress** – Tasks currently being worked on.  
  - 🟢 **Done** – Completed tasks.  
- You can add custom columns like **Backlog** or **Review Needed**.  

### 4️⃣ **Add Issues & Pull Requests**
- Click **+ Add Item** and search for an existing issue or pull request.  
- You can also create new issues directly from the board.  

### 5️⃣ **Automate Workflows**
- Use GitHub Actions to move tasks automatically when the status changes.  
- Example: Move an issue to **In Progress** when a linked pull request is opened.
