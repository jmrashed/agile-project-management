# 📌 RACI Matrix - Agile Project Management  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The RACI matrix helps define team roles and responsibilities for key activities in the Agile project.  

### 🔍 **Key Definitions:**  
- **R** = Responsible (Who does the work)  
- **A** = Accountable (Who makes the final decision)  
- **C** = Consulted (Who provides input)  
- **I** = Informed (Who is kept updated)
